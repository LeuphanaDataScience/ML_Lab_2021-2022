# ML_Lab_2021-2022

This repository is meant to be the hub for the code related to the course "Machine Learning Lab", winter term 2021/2022.

At some point we should agree on certain guidelines on how to use github and on how to write and structure code in order to make collaboration more smoothly
and maintain a clear and comprehensible structure.
