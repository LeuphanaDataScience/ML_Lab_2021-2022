    """
    Find the nearest node to a point or to each of several points.
    If `X` and `Y` are single coordinate values, this will return the nearest
    node to that point. If `X` and `Y` are lists of coordinate values, this
    will return the nearest node to each point.
    If the graph is projected, this uses a k-d tree for euclidean nearest
    neighbor search, which requires that scipy is installed as an optional
    dependency. If it is unprojected, this uses a ball tree for haversine
    nearest neighbor search, which requires that scikit-learn is installed as
    an optional dependency.

    ----------
    G : networkx.MultiDiGraph
