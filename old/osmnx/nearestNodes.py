    """
    Find the nearest node to a point or to each of several points.
    If `X` and `Y` are single coordinate values, this will return the nearest
    node to that point. If `X` and `Y` are lists of coordinate values, this
    will return the nearest node to each point.
    If the graph is projected, this uses a k-d tree for euclidean nearest
    neighbor search, which requires that scipy is installed as an optional
    dependency. If it is unprojected, this uses a ball tree for haversine
    nearest neighbor search, which requires that scikit-learn is installed as
    an optional dependency.
    Parameters
    ----------
    G : networkx.MultiDiGraph
        graph in which to find nearest nodes
    X : float or list
        points' x (longitude) coordinates, in same CRS/units as graph and
        containing no nulls
    Y : float or list
        points' y (latitude) coordinates, in same CRS/units as graph and
        containing no nulls
    return_dist : bool
        optionally also return distance between points and nearest nodes
    Returns
    -------
    nn or (nn, dist) : int/list or tuple
        nearest node IDs or optionally a tuple where `dist` contains distances
        between the points and their nearest nodes
