# Approach combining Clustering & Ant Colony Optimization 

This approach is designed to find good bus routes based on different setups (people being assigned to bus stops where they start).
To run this, you need to follow these steps.

## ----- REQUIREMENTS ------

Used packages:

- pandas
- numpy
- copy
- collections
- scipy
- random 
- math
- shutil
- time
- pickle
- os
- warnings
- openpyxl

## ----- HOW TO USE -----

1) 	Put a csv file including bus stops and number of passengers assigned to them in the folder "data".
	Examples here are "scenario_1.csv", "scenario_2.csv" & "scenario_3.csv".

2)	In the file "run.py", specify following variables

### Elementary (needs to be set to run on local machine)
- src:		project directory (string)
	
### Basic
- iterations:	specify number of iterations to run per clustering method (integer)
- identifier:	specify if stations should be output as "name" or "osmid" 
- scenario:	file name -> specify which scenario (setup)/ file you want to use as input (string)
- capacity:	bus capacity; specify number of passengers that should be at max in one bus (integer)


3)	Run the script "run.py" (providing arguments "scenario" and "identifier")

4)	The results are stored in a new folder (name starts with date & time run was started)

## ----- Additional -----

In the folder "ACO-PSO" there are approaches for finding good hyperparameter settings with Particle Swarm Optimization 
as well as new data for Landkreis LÃ¼neburg including some more bus stations and a file for cleaning and adjusting 
the distance matrices extracted from OSM.
